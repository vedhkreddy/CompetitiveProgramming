read in as a 2x2 array
also read in map : vector<vector<int>> that does NOT INCLUDE 0
    1 vector for x
    1 vector for y
also read in set that DOES NOT INCLUDE 0

set <int> notin;

iterate through set
    find min and max of x's and y'set
    for (int i = xmin; i < xmax; i++){
        for (int j = ymin; j < ymax; j++){
            if (array[i][j] != the current){
                add that current to notin
            }
        }
    }

iterate through full set
    check if int is in notin
    if not
        count++

return count
