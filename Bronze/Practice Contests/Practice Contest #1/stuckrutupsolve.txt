/*algorithm basic*/


iterate through pairs of cows
see if they are going to intersect
if they are check which cow will pass the intersecting point first
if pass at same time, continue
see how long it will take to reach that point
if it is the shortest so far store it in a data structure

after chosen eliminate
keep going until you cant find and make all the remaining infinity

//START 


read in input as bigvector and vector
while true
    iterate through vector
        iterate through vector again
            if not same and they are differnt directions
                check if the north one is below the east one and the east one is west of the north one
                find out which is closer to intersection point
                if the same
                    continue
                else if east is the last one
                    count up squares
                    if the smallest update a big variable and also store the cow that is getting boomed
    if count 10^10
        break
    iterate through bigvector
        update everything with count
    delete the stopped cow in vector
