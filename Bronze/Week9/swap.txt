read in N, K
make vector of 1...N
read in the four ints as pair of pairs
make four iterators of vector.begin()
go through the pairs and advance the iterators
make map of int to vector
go through and add 1...N to the map
for (int i = 0; i < (k%4) + 1; i++){
    reverse[iterator1, iterator2];
    reverse[iterator3, iterator4];
}

go through vector
    output
