os this is what you do:

if it is case 1:
    output correct answer

go through each case
    for 1....N
        for 1...N
            if 1:
                they have to add up to N
            if 2:
                the third one has to add up to N
            if 3: the third and fourth are dictated because in total there has to be N - 1 d's and N - 1 r's
            make the list
